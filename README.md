# TTC-Delay-Analysis

I would like to sincerely thank our Capstone professor, Samer Al-Obaidi, for his continuous guidance, support, and valuable insights throughout the project.

A special appreciation goes to my amazing teammates —
Anandhapriya Venkatachalam, Saraniyan Selvakumar, Seneta Teresa D Rozario, Sukriti Suman, and Mansi — for their dedication, collaboration, and shared passion in bringing this TTC delay analysis project to life. This project was a true team effort, and it wouldn’t have been possible without everyone’s hard work and contributions.
