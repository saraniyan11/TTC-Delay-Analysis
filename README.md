# TTC-Delay-Analysis

I want to express my gratitude to Samer Al-Obaidi, our capstone lecturer, for his unwavering leadership, encouragement, and insightful advice during the assignment.

My incredible coworkers, Anandhapriya Venkatachalam, Seneta Teresa D. Rozario, Sukriti Suman, and Mansi, deserve special recognition for their commitment, teamwork, and passion in making this TTC delay study project a reality. Without everyone's efforts and contributions, this project would not have been feasible. It was a genuine team effort.


In order to find significant insights on TTC delays, our team has conducted extensive study, gathered, analyzed, and interpreted data. We developed this project together using Power BI and Excel, backed by statistics pertaining to streetcar, bus, and subway delays as well as subway delay codes. 
I supplied the tools and data bases required to mold and direct the analytical procedure. The TTC delay tale has come to life as a result of our collaborative efforts to turn raw data into a comprehensive report that includes a Power BI dashboard that presents our results in an understandable and interactive manner.
